# Airline Management System
# Problem Description

•	Use a data structure like an array, linked list, or hash table to store flight 
  records(flightnumber,name,source,destination).

•	Implement functions to add,remove,and search for flight-by- flight number and name.

•	Use sorting algorithms like merge sort or quick sort to arrange airline alphabetically or by 
  other attributes.

•	Implement search algorithms like binary search or linear search for efficient book lookup.

•	Consider using a tree datastructure like a binary search tree or tree for hierarchical 
  organization and efficient searches.

•	Implement datastructures like queues or priority queues for handling book reservations and 
  waitlists.

•	Handle fine calculation algorithms.

•	Provide a user interface for admin in airline example(Station master) to interact with the 
  system. They can only able to delete the airline.
